websiteCheck is a Python script that will email a user once a website has been updated/changed. This depends on how much of the website is written in JavaScript. It can be tied with AWS, Google Cloud, or used by hardware such as Raspberry Pi. This is a personal project for myself to check a website I've been looking over frequently.
