websiteCheck is a Python script that will email a user once a website has been updated/changed. This depends on how much of the website is written in JavaScript, as Selenium is not used in this script. It can be tied with AWS, Google Cloud, or used by hardware such as Raspberry Pi. This is a personal project for myself to check a website I've been looking over frequently.

Code is still in the works. Planning on adding a way to search for a string on a website and monitor that string, rather than the entire website.
